HW #1 - due by 2/2

1. Using MARS write a MIPS assembly language program to prompt the user to input two 32-bit integers X and Y (X and Y can be prompted separately or at the same time), get them from the user then store them in memory locations labeled X and Y respectively. The program then loads X and Y from the main memory to registers, calculates the difference of them (i.e. X - Y) and store the difference into a memory location labeled D. The program then prints out the result (i.e. integer D) after printing the string "The difference of X and Y (X - Y) is ".

Then assemble and run the program with MARS to show and capture the input/output.

Follows the instructions for programming assignments in the syllabus. The sreenshot(s) showing results of your program execution should be in a separate file.

2. Answer the following questions:

2.1 Describe the process of translating a program written in a High-Level Language (HLL), e.g. C++, into an executable file that is ready for execution. Identify the system programs used in the process and describe the role of each of them assuming that the compiler generates an assembly language file as the output.

What is the system program used by the Operating System (OS) to load an executable file to memory and run it?

2.2 Describe the elements, including optional ones, of a MIPS assembly language statement.

Answers to these questions of part 2. should be in a MS Word document.

Submit your work in a ZIP file to eLearning by the due date. If you are not familiar with the ZIP file format you can find out more about it from this link:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)  

Note: name your ZIP files for homework submission as follows:

<hw#>_<FirstName>_<LastName>.zip, e.g. 01_Jane_Doe.zip

IMPORTANT: do not use another archive format, e.g. RAR, because the grader will not be able to see your files, and you will get 0 points.
